# Limit Order Book Extension for GAN

This repository contains the code for the experiment of extending GAN to generate realistic Limit Order Book snippets. Feature Matching, Minibatch Discrimination and Label Smoothing's effect on generated LOB snippets has been explored. 

The code includes an experiment code that allows random generation of hyperparameters, which helps in exploring the optimal hyperparameter value. Each model's configuration and metrics will also be saved. 
Codes to plot the metrics of each model into images and comparing between models are also included.  

Real life LOB snippet from raw data has been plotted for comparison with generated snippets.
