# Improved Techniques for Training GANs

This repository contains implementation code for the paper "Improved Techniques for Training GANs" by Tim Salimans, Ian Goodfellow, Wojciech Zaremba, Vicki Cheung, Alec Radford, and Xi Chen.

## Project Overview

This project is a collaborative effort by Group 9 for DSA5204, focusing on reproduction and extension of techniques for improving GAN training stability and performance. Our work is divided into three subgroups:

### Group 1: Original GAN Implementation
- Replication of the core techniques from the paper
- Implementation of Feature Matching, Minibatch Discrimination, and Virtual Batch Normalization
- Training on image datasets (CIFAR10)
- Evaluation using FID metric

### Group 2: Limit Order Book (LOB) Synthesis
- Extension of GAN techniques to financial data
- Generation of market data capturing buy/sell order dynamics
- Adaptation of GAN architecture for LOB data

### Group 3: Transformer-Based GANs
- Integration of transformer architectures with GANs
- Replacement of convolutional layers with self-attention mechanisms
- Implementation of multi-scale attention in the discriminator
- Application of relative position encoding for spatial consistency
